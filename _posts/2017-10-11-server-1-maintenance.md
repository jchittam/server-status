## Maintenance Complete (11:50 PM)

The host has finished moving everything to the new node and everything should be back online. I will continue to monitor the server to make sure everything stays online. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns!

### Update (11:30 PM)

The host just began merging all the contents of the server to the new node. The sites may be down for the next 30 minutes or so. Thank you for your patience!

### Original post: Server Maintenance Tonight

Server 1 may be down for around 30 minutes tonight starting around 11:00 PM Eastern time. The host is moving the entire server to a different node to hopefully fix the packet loss issues we've been having the past few days. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for your patience the past few days!
