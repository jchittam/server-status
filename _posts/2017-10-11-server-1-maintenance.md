## Server Maintenance Tonight

Server 1 may be down for around 30 minutes tonight starting around 11:00 PM Eastern time. The host is moving the entire server to a different node to hopefully fix the packet loss issues we've been having the past few days. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for your patience the past few days!
